<h1>Risk Assessment Worksheet</h1>

<h3>Business Impact Analysis</h3>
<p>Use the slider controls to select the estimated business impact for each of the given factors. For the purposes of the risk assessment, business impact factors are automatically weighted
    depending on the industry and facility type however, a high safety or danger-to-life rating will always have a higher weight against other factors fpr the purposes of calculating event costs and overall risk rating.</p>
<p>Click on the slider labels to invoke a text field for entering optional justifications for each of the business impact factors. The justification text is not used for the risk assessment scoring however, will be included in reports</p>

<h3>Execute Risk Assessment</h3>
<p>Clicking "Execute Risk Assessment" invokes interaction with iOTa's AI interface. Each of the factors given in the user selected values is assessed against industry data relevant to the
given industry, type of facility, selected scenario, and the business impact analysis. The AI model considers each of these factors to generate four values:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Risk Score.</b> This is a subjective score with a maximum value of 10 where 1 is very low risk and 10 denotes a catastrophic business risk. </li>
    <li><b>Risk Rating.</b> This is a subjective rating aligned with the risk score. </li>
    <li><b>Estimated Event Costs.</b> Industry data is analysed against the given scenario and business impact analysis to predict the cost that may be associated in the event of the scenario occurring. </li>
    <li><b>Risk Summary.</b> A machine generated justification for the provided risk score/rating.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Estimated Event Costs are heavily weighted towards the safety, danger-to-life, and environmental aspects of the business analysis, and the given value is intended as a guide that may or may not reflect a real-world outcome. Other factors outside the scope of cyber/physical security risk assessment may be relevant and mean that
actual event costs are higher or lower. The value is also dependent on user inputs. <b>If the user executes the risk assessment then subsequently makes changes to the business impact assessment for any of the scenarios, the worksheet cannot be saved until the risk assessment for the scenario in which the changes were made has been re-executed</b> </p>
