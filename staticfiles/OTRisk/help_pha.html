<h1>CyberPHA Scenarios</h1>
<p>
    iOTa allows analysis of multiple scenarios for each CyberPHA. Complete the steps described below for each scenario.
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>
        A scenario is the specific event that is being analysed for the cyberPHA. Select the scenario to analyse from the Scenario table. There are around 400 real-world and hypothetical scenarios entered into the database.
        Use the search box to search for a scenario by keyword. When a scenario is selected, the text of the scenario will be copied to the text field located next to the
        scenario table. The user can use the scenario as-is, or edit the scenario's wording.
        <b>Important to note that the scenario analysis will be performed on the wording entered into this text box so make it as specific and descriptive as possible</b>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Consequence are the things that occur as a result of the scenario. Select up to three consequences (otherwise known as "bad outcomes" or "impacts") from the Consequence table. There are around 2000 real-world and hypothetical consequences in the database
        . Use the search box to search for a consequence by keyword. Each selected entry will be added to the text field
        located next to the consequence table. The text for each consequence may be edited and the user may also enter their consequence.
        <b>Important to note that the scenario analysis will be performed based on the consequences entered into the text field so make the consequences as specific and descriptive as possible</b>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        A threat source is the actor or originator of the threat that results in the scenario. Select the most relevant threat source from the drop down list
    </li>
    <li>
        A threat source is the actor or originator of the threat that results in the scenario. Select the most relevant threat source from the drop down list
    </li>
    <li>
        After selecting applicable standards in the drop-down, clicking on the "assess scenario" button executes a query that utilizes machine learning and artificial intelligence to determine the
        following information:<br>
        - The recommended controls to address the scenario in addition to the controls already selected by the user. Controls will be presented in order of the most likely priority and effectiveness <br>
        - A list of recommendations in alignment with the selected standards<br>
        <b>Important: note that the algorithm executes in real-time. The nature of AI means the way that recommendations are described may differ if the function is repeatedly executed for the same information.
            While the scoring should remain consistent it may change over time if new threats and vulnerabilities  become known. </b><br>
            <b>Note also that the inputs are frequently being adjusted and refined to improve accuracy. This process may result in changes to the algorithms output. </b><br>
        <b>AI generated values, recommendations, and controls may be over-ridden by the user. Every scenario requires careful consideration. AI responds to the input information and the full context of the scenario needs to be considered</b>
