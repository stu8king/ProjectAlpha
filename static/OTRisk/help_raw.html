<h1>Risk Assessment Worksheet</h1>

<p>
    The risk assessment worksheet is intended to be used to address the need to conduct scenario-based risk assessments. The worksheet enables assessment of up to 5 scenarios for a given business unit.
    If there are more than 5 scenarios to assess then consider either using the CyberPHA assessment which allows any number of scenarios, or creating additional worksheets to assess the extra scenarios.

</p>
<p>
    Previously entered risk assessments for your organization will be displayed in the table at the top of the page. To view an existing risk assessment, select if from the table and the fields on the web page will be populated with the details</p>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Business Impact Analysis</h3>
<p>Use the slider controls to select the estimated business impact for each of the given factors. For the purposes of the risk assessment, business impact factors are automatically weighted
    depending on the industry and facility type however, a high safety or danger-to-life rating will always have a higher weight against other factors fpr the purposes of calculating event costs and overall risk rating.</p>
<p>Click on the slider labels to invoke a text field for entering optional justifications for each of the business impact factors. The justification text is not used for the risk assessment scoring however, will be included in reports</p>

<h3>Execute Risk Assessment</h3>
<p>Note: A result of "Non-Compliant" in the risk assessment fields means that one or more terms entered into the scenario field is contrary to the terms and conditions of using this application.
    Terminology that could be rated as vulgar or harmful is automatically disallowed. Repeated attempts to submit such terms will result in the automatic suspension of the user account concerned</p>
<p>There may be instances where the scenario is rated as non-compliant but appears benign. In which instance either try to reword the scenario to be less ambiguous or submit a help ticket</p>
<p>Clicking "Execute Risk Assessment" invokes interaction with iOTa's AI interface. Each of the factors given in the user selected values is assessed against industry data relevant to the
given industry, type of facility, selected scenario, and the business impact analysis. The AI model considers each of these factors to generate four values:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Risk Score.</b> This is a subjective score with a maximum value of 10 where 1 is very low risk and 10 denotes a catastrophic business risk. </li>
    <li><b>Risk Rating.</b> This is a subjective rating aligned with the risk score. </li>
    <li><b>Estimated Event Costs.</b> Industry data is analysed against the given scenario and business impact analysis to predict the cost that may be associated in the event of the scenario occurring. </li>
    <li><b>Risk Summary.</b> A machine generated justification for the provided risk score/rating.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Estimated Event Costs are heavily weighted towards the safety, danger-to-life, and environmental aspects of the business analysis, and the given value is intended as a guide that may or may not reflect a real-world outcome. Other factors outside the scope of cyber/physical security risk assessment may be relevant and mean that
actual event costs are higher or lower. The value is also dependent on user inputs. <b>If the user executes the risk assessment then subsequently makes changes to the business impact assessment for any of the scenarios, the worksheet cannot be saved until the risk assessment for the scenario in which the changes were made has been re-executed</b> </p>
